# PairwiseSequenceAlignment
Created to specifically handle the pairwise sequence alignment and calculation of distance score between DNA sequences.
The pairwise sequence alignment was performed by implementing the Needleman-Wunsch algorithmâ€™s steps-- creating a table, choosing between match/mismatch/gap, and following the optimal alignment path. 
The distance score was found by implementing methods within the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm to calculate the number of total alignment, indel, and match columns so they could be inputted into the distance calculator. 
Once these methods had been run through, the alignment was then printed along with the distance score.
